<h1>Why I want to become a developer?</h1>
	<p>I want to become a developer because I enjoy solving problems and creating things that are useful in real life. Development allows me to turn ideas into reality using logic and creativity. I find satisfaction in writing code, fixing errors, and improving how applications work.</p>
